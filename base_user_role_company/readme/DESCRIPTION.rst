Enable User Roles depending on the Companies selected.

A company specific Role will only be enabled
if it is set for **all** the currently selected companies.

For example, if a user is "Sales Manager" only for Company A,
it will see that role enabled only if Company A is selected.
If the user selects Company A and Company B,
then the "Sales Manager" role won't be enabled.
