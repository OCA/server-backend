This module allows to retrieve mails from a mailbox on the local file system.

That's useful when your Odoo instance runs on a server with a local mailserver that delivers mails into a mailbox accessible by the user Odoo is running as, because it allows you to fetch mails without any credentials or TCP/connection overhead.
