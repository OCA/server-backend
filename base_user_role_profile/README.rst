Extending the base_user_role module, this one adds the notion of profiles. Effectively profiles act as an additional filter to how the roles are used. Through the new widget, much in the same way that a user can switch companies when they are part of the multi company group, users have the possibility to change profiles when they are part of the multi profiles group.

This allows users to switch their permission groups dynamically. This can be useful for example to:
 - finer grain control on menu and model permissions (with record rules this becomes very flexible)
 - break down complicated menus into simpler ones
 - easily restrict users accidentally editing or creating records in O2M fields and in general misusing the interface, instead of excessively explaining things to them

Configuration
=============

Go to Configuration / Users / Profiles and create a profile. Go to Configuration / Users / Roles and define some role lines with profiles.

Usage
=====

Once you have set up at least one profile for a user, use the widget in the top bar to switch user profiles. Note that it is possible to use no profile; in this case, the user will only get the roles that always apply (i.e the ones with no profile_id).
