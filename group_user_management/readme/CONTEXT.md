The purpose of this module is to add a new group for user management to grant user
authorization to manage users but without allowing configuration of other stuff of the instance
(as default Administration > Access Rights can do)

In other terms, if you want to get a user administrator on your instance that will :
  - Create new users
  - Update user rights
  - Update passwords or generate renew password links
  - Archive or remove users

But is not authorized to :
  - Grant himself (or anyone else) Administration / Access Rights or Administration / Settings role
  - Update advanced configuration of the instance
  - Update access rights / ir rules
  - Create or Update existing groups
