This module provides a generic tool to have the possibility to see a list of
records associated to a given selection of records. This is basically the UI version of ``recordset.mapped('field1.field2')``.

For example, if you use the sale module, you can configure an action to see
all the products that have been sold for a given selection of sale orders.
