To configure this module, you need to go to *Settings / Users / Roles*,
and create a new role. From there, you can add groups to compose your
role, and then associate users to it.

You can also define default roles for a new user by editing the user
called "Default User".

Roles:

Add groups:

Add users (with dates or not):

![](/OCA/server-backend/16.0/base_user_role/static/description/role_users.png)

Instead of creating roles from scratch, it is possible to create a role
based on the groups of an existing user: select or open the user and
choose "Create role from user" in the action menu.
