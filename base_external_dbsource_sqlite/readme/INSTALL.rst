To install this module, you need to:

* Install ``sqlalchemy`` python library

To use `specific dialects <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/dialects/index.html>`__,
you will have to install their dependencies too. These can be other Python
libraries, or some OS binaries. Refer to upstream docs.

The SQLite connector needs no extra dependencies.
